# SQL-Database-Power-BI-Dashboard
I took on the challenge of answering pivotal questions through the development of an insightful Dashboard, employing a combination of SQL and Power BI. 
The project delved into three key inquiries:

Hotel Revenue Growth: I explored the data to discern whether our hotel's revenue is experiencing a positive trajectory year by year. 
This involved a comprehensive analysis of financial data, enabling us to gain a nuanced understanding of the revenue patterns over time.

Parking Occupation Optimization: Another crucial aspect addressed was the optimization of parking occupation. 
By leveraging SQL and Power BI, I sought to determine whether there is a strategic need to increase our parking occupancy on an annual basis. 
This analysis aimed to enhance operational efficiency and accommodate potential growth in demand.

Data Trends Analysis: Beyond specific queries, the project also entailed a broader examination of data trends. 
Through the adept use of analytical tools, I identified and visualized patterns, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the evolving dynamics within the dataset.
